José Valim is the creator of the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. Austin Erlang is taking a deeper look into José's life to quantify the tenets of successful programming and living a rich and rewarding life.

## Introduction

José was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1986. He is married with one young child. His parents are still together and he has one older brother. He has a large and traditional Brazillian extended family back home. By all indications, a happy and extremely supportive family. He graduated in Engineering from São Paulo University, Brazil and has a Master of Science from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. Today he works as the director of R&D at [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/).

I sat down in Krakow, Poland at the Erlang Solutions office with José for an interview shortly after the 2016 Erlang Conference in Stockholm. I had a totally unscripted talk with him beginning with his upbringing and finishing with off-the-wall questions about his diet, health, and daily habits. I didn't know what to expect but I learned a great deal from the conversation and have attempted to capture it succinctly in this writing. I hope this is useful to you on your path of self improvement.

## Strong Foundations

José's parents provided an extremely good foundation for the life that was to evolve into the José we all know and love today! José's parents were aware of the dynamics of the Brazilian educational system and knew that enrolling him in a private school was the only way to guarantee his access to higher education later in life. Despite financial hurdles, his parents prioritized his education and ensured José attended private schooling. In Brazil, you're not likely to be accepted into a University as it's highly competitive and performance based. Without access to private education it's likely we would never have come to know José at all.

The bonds of family are strong in José's life, as his brother and parents have since relocated 6,501 miles (10,463 km) from Brazil to Poland to live with José. It's evident José has a very supportive family which provides him with a strong base. It's easy to understand how significant this is to one's upbringing.

He stands as an ideal example of how someone with a reasonable amount of opportunity can hope to rise up to the level of expertise necessary to make the kinds of contributions he has and make a good living. His path from a young boy to author, entrepreneur, Rails Core Team contributor, and creator of [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is one that should be well understood as we can learn many lessons from it. Looking back on his path reveals a deceptively seamless transition from one good situation to the next, continually building on his strengths and developing new ones.

## Focus, Curiosity, and Humility

If I were forced to summarize José in one word, I would be very tempted to say "focused". His success is no doubt in part due to his ability to focus. However, it's his ability to decide what to focus on which is most important. I find far too many people don't understand what is important or how to focus on it if they do. He has a very keen sense of what is and isn't relevant to achieving his goals in life. If I could only take one thing away from this interview, that would be it.

> _"The shortest way to do many things is to do only one thing at a time."_ ― [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart)

Curious from a young age, his inquisitive nature has directly lead him down the path of expertise in his chosen field. He lets things come into his awareness and is curious enough to follow up with it individually. It's well known [curiosity](http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/HungryMind_PPS_2011.pdf) is profoundly important in the acquisition of knowledge, but it's also clear he tempers his curious side with a high degree of focus to ensure he's not dividing his attention too much. He jumps into subjects asking questions one by one as he reveals the answers by independent experimentation or with the help of others.

> _"No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives."_ ― [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson)

He is humble. He won't hold anything over you and he will make you feel very comfortable. He's also not afraid to ask questions that others might find embarrassing; he's not afraid to reveal any break in his knowledge in order to fill the gaps. In the end, he's going to win every time because only those who ask the questions obtain the knowledge. At his core, his humility serves as a strength to permit the perpetual flow of learning and grow the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) community. A study done at the Catalyst Research Centers on [Inclusive Leadership](http://www.catalyst.org/system/files/inclusive_leadership_the_view_from_six_countries_0.pdf) shows humility to be a cornerstone of effective leadership.

## The benefits of teaching what you learn

One of the tenets I find among experts is that they typically mentor others in some way. There is usually an outlet that you can find where they form their knowledge for the understanding of others. This process is critical as it ensures one's understanding of a subject is deep enough to guide an audience to the same understanding. From a young age José explained that he was very good about keeping up with helping others in class. I believe this mentality prepared him well for the task of educating others by doing conference talks, writing books, blogs, documentation, or even one-on-one sessions. This also ensured he would develop a better understanding of subjects as he would eventually have to formulate it into something digestible by others whether for a talk or in code.

## Exposure to Programming

His first time programming was actually while in an Introduction to Computer Science class at the University of São Paulo. He decided from then on he really liked programming and today even expressed that he lost interest in his selected program rather quickly after making this discovery. In his early years at the University he started seeking freelance work in the programming field. He started with Flash then moved into PHP+SQL and even exchanged about 9 months music lessons for website work. A [Pereto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) to be sure! In fact, this is something I noticed immediately about José. He has a track record of investing his time in opportunities which yielded multiple benefits.

## Discovering how to succeed by asking how to fail

He also seems to ask questions not obvious to others. In a simple example, he explained while in a lecture he asked what will happen if returning a 1 from my function instead of a 0? The professor was explaining it was very important to return a 0. The entire class accepted this and was ready to move on. Not José, he demonstrated something critical which is to understand the various ways which one can fail at doing something up front so it's well understood where the known pitfalls are. Take this mentality of discovering how to fail and apply it to tougher problems, you might imagine the benefits.

## Benefits of community

From an early time during his University years, he began engaging in the Ruby community. His engagement in the Ruby community would constantly increase his awareness. He started speaking at Ruby conferences in Brazil since the beginning. After a few years, others became familiar with him and his work. Many opportunities opened up from this. He and a group of friends were able to establish themselves as authorities in the community and convert that into a successful consultancy later on called [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/).

While living in Italy during his masters program, he applied to enter the Google Summer of Code during the year of 2009. He submitted an idea to the Rails Core team which was very much in line with their thinking. He met Yehuda Katz who mentored him heavily throughout the summer and gave him a firm footing in Rails which led to an invitation to join the Rails Core team. José's work allowed Rails to be more agnostic and enabled people to use alternatives to ActiveRecord, ERb and TestUnit.

By the time José completed his masters degree in 2010, he had developed a very strong footing in the Ruby community and a solid understanding of programming concepts.

## The move to the Erlang VM

After José graduated and was working full time for [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/), the consultancy he co-founded, his partners continued to support him as he spoke at conferences, contributed to Rails, and wrote his first book. It's well documented elsewhere that he sought to resolve the concurrency story of the Ruby language by studying the concepts behind other technologies. I am only interested in the opportunities which afforded this. The soil from which [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) was grown.

As he explained, it was due to his first Polish winter that he stayed locked indoors while he brainstormed solutions to the concurrency issues he was set on solving. Turning to Erlang he developed a very basic POC on Github called [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), which compiled to the Erlang AST. He studied every language he could find which was on the Erlang VM including Erlang itself to understand how to write the compiler. A year after the initial prototype he pitched the idea to everyone back in Brazil at [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/) and everyone supported him. He was eventually phased out of doing much client work and focused primarily on [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and academic research.

It is absolutely vital that we recognize the people of [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/) for their faith and confidence in José and their willingness to back it up by doing the client work to pay the bills while José was able to work on the future of the company. Without their contributions, there would be no [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) today. Which by all means, looks to be the future of the Erlang VM as the dominant language. The combination of the Ruby mindset and the Erlang VM is a recipe for long term success.

What can we learn from this for our own lives? José started a company which later enabled him the time to innovate. Again, he seems to intuit where the opportunities for [Pareto efficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) lie. Or, he knows how to kill multiple birds with one stone. We too can realize that to enable ourselves to truly solve big problems and make a difference we can create these types of situations for ourselves.

## Lessons Learned

A summary of lessons learned from the interview with José.

- Observe one's self.
  - recognized he needed down time to let complex concepts resonate
  - understands his limits with conversation and avoids reactionary answers
  - know your limits and don't be afraid to let others contribute if they can do it better
- Memory isn't everything
	- José has a terrible memory (by his own account) and apparently this is not a big deficit for him :)
- Mentors are not everything
	- To my surprise, José doesn't really have any mentors today. However, he did have Yehuda Katz for a time.
- FOCUS
	- Focus is everything, without it José wouldn't have accomplished all he has. However, it's not enough to know how to focus, you must focus on that which drives you to your goal.
- Self promotion and speaking
  - It's important to verbalize what you are doing in life with others. You can become a self promoter to open up opportunities.
- Social interaction to increase awareness
	- Attend conferences, meetups, read books and bring as much into your awareness as you can. Then focus down on what is important to driving you towards your goal.
- Curiosity
	- Allow your curiosity to lead your acquisition of knowledge, but don't let curiosity lead you down a rabbit hole, find the threshold and consider your investment of time.
- Balancing your time wisely
	- There is a lot to learn. Invest in what will pay you back.
- Persistence
	- José didn't seem to be persistent in a negative way which would keep him committed to things that weren't working in his life.
- Managing your time and not burning out
	- José works some lighter weeks every now and then. It's important to find balance. As the saying goes, slow and steady wins the race.
- Working in serial with an eye towards the future
	- José will spend most of his day in focused mode on just one project. Then, he'll bounce around projects answering questions or patching bugs and take at least 30 minutes in the evening to continue researching the next project on the docket. On occasion, when he reaches the next project he's already got the mechanics of the solution worked out and just needs to write the code.
- Humility
	- Don't be afraid to ask questions, be open for change.
- Find space where you can focus
- Explore your dependencies
	- Don't trust the code you're including into your project without understanding it. Be curious enough to explore.
- Keeping it simple
  - he wants to keep [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) simple
  - write code that is less complex and not tightly coupled together
- Work yourself out of your project
- Create an anchor to propel you to reach your goals and realize your success.
	- José utilized several anchors in his life to pull him up to the next levels. Such as conferences, people he met, opportunities such as Google Summer of Code, authorship, and [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/) where he cultivated the time for innovation.
