title: New Site!

Welcome to the, very basic, new blog site for AustinErlang.org.

We plan to spend a lot more time formally documenting ongoing research we are doing in the Erlang field. We'll be bringing you information from all facets of computer science and other programming languages important to the excellence in programming we are working towards.

We meet on average 10 times per year in Austin, Texas to discuss Erlang. I personally have a high preference for teaching in workshops! I much prefer to deliver a hands on experience to our members delivering actionable information and skills they can immediately apply in their daily lives.

We're on a mission to achieve excellence in programming through humility and pursuit of knowledge from mentors across all areas of the field. This blog will document the knowledge gained and hopefully serve a purpose to our members and add value to the meetup group.

For those afar, we'll be starting to record the meetups and publish the videos online.

Happy coding!
